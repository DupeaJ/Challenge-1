# Challenge-1
## Description
For my Challenge 1, I had to take a website with starter code and convert the code to semantic HTML. Doing so by getting rid of the Div's allows the website to rank higher in google search engine
as well as make the code easier to understand. Its easier to understand beacuse all elements have a correct tags and are in order. It's also more accesible with pictures having correct and accurate alts.
CSS also has notes for easy understanding of the styling. 
I learned what it means to make a website Semantic and what it helps contrubute to the website to do so.
I learned some new Tags as well, such as nav for navigation links and aside to have a side section with some more notes.
